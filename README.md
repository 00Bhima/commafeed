Deployment on your own server
-----------------------------

CommaFeed 2.0 has been rewritten to use Dropwizard and gulp instead of using tomee and wro4j. The latest version of the 1.x branch is available [here](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/tree/1.x).

For storage, you can either use an embedded H2 database or an external MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLServer database.
You also need Maven 3.x (and a Java 1.7+ JDK) installed in order to build the application.

To install maven and openjdk on Ubuntu, issue the following commands

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:natecarlson/maven3
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk maven3
    
    # Not required but if you don't, use 'mvn3' instead of 'mvn' for the rest of the instructions.
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/mvn3 /usr/bin/mvn
    
On Windows and other operating systems, just download maven 3.x from the [official site](http://maven.apache.org/), extract it somewhere and add the `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
    
Clone this repository. If you don't have git you can download the sources as a zip file from [here](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/archive/master.zip)

    git clone https://github.com/Athou/commafeed.git
    cd commafeed
    
Now build the application

    mvn clean package
    
Copy `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` then edit the file to your liking.
Issue the following command to run the app, the server will listen by default on ``http://localhost:8082`. The default user is `admin` and the default password is `admin`.

	java -jar target/commafeed.jar server config.yml

You can use a proxy http server such as nginx or apache.

Deployment on OpenShift
-----------------------------

 [OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com) is Red Hat's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that allows developers to quickly develop, host, and scale applications in a cloud environment. Commafeed runs perfectly on OpenShift and can even be used in the free tier. Follow the [Getting Started](https://developers.openshift.com/en/getting-started-overview.html) guide and after you sign up and install the Command Line Tools (RHC), do:

	rhc create-app commafeed diy-0.1 mysql-5.5
	cd commafeed
	git remote add upstream -m master https://github.com/Athou/commafeed.git
	git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
	git push

Local development
-----------------

To start the dropwizard backend, use your IDE to run CommaFeedApplication as your main class, and pass `server config.dev.yml` as arguments to the program.
To start the client-side webserver with watches on assets, run `gulp dev`. The server is now running on port 8082 and is proxying REST requests to dropwizard on port 8083.


Translate CommaFeed into your language
--------------------------------------

Files for internationalization are located [here](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/tree/master/src/main/app/i18n).

To add a new language, create a new file in that directory.
The name of the file should be the two-letters [ISO-639-1 language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
The language has to be referenced in the `src/main/app/js/i18n.js` file to be picked up.

Themes
---------------------

To create a theme, create a new file  `src/main/webapp/sass/themes/_<theme>.scss`. Your styles should be wrapped in a `#theme-<theme>` element and use the [SCSS format](http://sass-lang.com/) which is a superset of CSS.

Don't forget to reference your theme in `src/main/webapp/sass/app.scss` and in `src/main/webapp/js/controllers.js` (look for `$scope.themes`).

See [_test.scss](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/blob/master/src/main/webapp/sass/themes/_test.scss) for an example.
